## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets used for data analysis and machine learning practice.  
In this notebook, we:
- Load and explore the Titanic dataset.
- Perform **data cleaning** (handling missing values, data types, etc.).
- Conduct **univariate and multivariate analysis**.
- Visualize relationships between survival and different passenger features.
- Gain insights that can be useful for building predictive models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – for static visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – for statistical data visualization

## 📊 Key Insights
Some of the questions explored in this notebook:
- How many passengers survived vs. did not survive?  
- What role did **gender** and **age** play in survival rates?  
- Did **passenger class (Pclass)** affect survival chances?  
- Were there correlations between **family size, fare, and survival**?
